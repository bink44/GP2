# Abstract
This project proposes a system that identifies and analyzes the human personalities from the long video with 2 persons having a conversation. This will be accompanied by a labeling system that correctly tracks and recognizes each person in the video, a recognition system that distinguishes human actions & facial expressions. The result will provide explanations of the reasons in a natural language for each person. In this field, there is an existing attempt to analyze personality from the interview video using speaker’s intonation. However, there is a limitation that intonation would not be an enough indicator for personality. The main idea of this project is that it will be possible to derive a person's personality more accurately from the video that two people are having a conversation than the video that one person is speaking. 2 kinds of methods are selected to evaluate this project. From the first evaluation, it is assumed that the idea is reliable since more diverse labels have been detected from the videos of two people having a conversation, and the frequency and accuracy of detected labels are higher. Second evaluation was human evaluation to check the accuracy of inferred personality. However, due to the low number of test targets and mis-selection of the sample videos, the results are vague. There is still room to improve with this project. However, it has been successfully proved that the video of two people speaking is more suitable for inferring a person's characteristics than a single speech video throughout the project.
